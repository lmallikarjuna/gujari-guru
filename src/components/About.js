          <h3>GUJARIGURU</h3> We are here to help people who are willing to
          recycle their scrap for the environment and as a token of
          appreciation, we pay you. Recycling of used goods is of utmost
          importance in the present generation as it has huge benefits. So it is
          everyoneâ€™s responsibility to recycle. Newspapers, plastic, metal,
          electronics, etc. We recycle them all, and it is fantastic! Get
          connected to GUJARI GURU and join the team. Currently, most of us are
          thinking that recycling is inconvenient because we do not put any
          extra effort to accumulate recyclable scraps and go to the recycling
          center to deposit the accumulated scrap. When recyclable scraps are
          not recycled then it leads to wastage of water, electricity, cutting
          of trees, landfills, and air pollution. 1 ton of recycled paper saves
          approximately 17 trees, 2.5 barrels of oil, 4100kwh of electricity,
          and 32000 liters of water overproduction of virgin paper from wood.
          Believe it or not, India imports scrap paper from neighboring
          countries because only 20% of the papers are recycled in India.

          <h3>HOW TO RECYCLE?</h3> Gujari Guru is an online platform to sell
          your scrap, helping society to recycle more waste by enabling the
          recycling sector. You can do it by sitting in your home, office by
          just giving us missed calls, text messages, a ping in our Whatsapp
          account, or by reaching our very own website gujariguru.com. Contact
          us and we will be there at your doorsteps with an electronic weighing
          machine to weigh the accumulated scrap and provide the right value for
          your scrap which local recycling agents cannot offer you. The
          collected scrap is then given to the recycling centers for recycling.
